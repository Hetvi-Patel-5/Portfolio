As for the code, i did refer to a website made by my friend, Purva Patel. 
Here's the link for it: https://purvapatel4725.github.io/purvapatel/#home 
I refered this for social media part and also took idea for structure for the website.

I also referred to the TA's portfolio website (ghazal bangash). 
mainly referred it for navigation bar, and home page design. 
she made us do it in the tutorial... so basically it''s just that.
